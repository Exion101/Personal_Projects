  <p>This repository is a collection of Scripts I have created to make a task easier...</p>
  
<h3>Simple Interest and Compound Interest Calculator</h3>
  <p>I created this script to automate and reduce the amount of work for my <b>Mathematics of Finance</b> project. In this script I automate the calculations I needed and placed them onto tables on an Excel spreadsheet. Currently, the script uses hard-coded values for interest and time. My next update, is add user inputs so that anyone can use this program with their own values.</p>
